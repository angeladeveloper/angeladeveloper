- 👋 Hi, I’m Angela W
- 👀 I’m interested in everything to do with coding and design. I would love to learn about new projects that people are working on, and discover new technologies. I would love to make connections with anyone in the field to grow my network. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. I started out teaching myself, but I recently enrolled in a UW's bootcamap. I will end up learning just about everything I need to start making full stack applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYHING! I really want exposure. I know that I love the fundamentals of coding and problem solving, but I am still not sure where I will find my stride. I really want to get my hands dirty with as many things as I can, so when the time comes, I can make the best descions and I'll have TONS of experience under my belt by then, making me an even better developer.
